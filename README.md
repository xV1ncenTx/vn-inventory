# vn-inventory used with QBCore Framework

Here's my own take and spin on the design. This is was made off the awesome inventory [ihyajb](https://github.com/ihyajb) made and [loljoshie](https://github.com/loljoshie)
<br>

# Key Features
* ALL IMAGES FOLLOW THE SAME DIMENSIONS
* Easy Photoshop guideline template for creating custom images within vn-inventory
* Custom brand logo above option buttons
* Options menu
* Help box 
* Custom inventory images (more always being added in each new update)
* Default weight icon easily changeable with Font Awesome icons
* Hotkey numbers visible in inventory and hotbar slots
* Weight progress bar
* Tooltip has a determined height (so it won't ever go higher than visible or cut off)
* Text overflow ellipsis used (so your product titles with never overlap the containers and instead do "...")
* Blurred inventory background
* Elements of NoPixel 3.5 design ideas interwoven
